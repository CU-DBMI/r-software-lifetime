Consequently, environment variable R_CHECK_LENGTH_1_CONDITION no longer has any effect.\nWindows users should consult the WINDOWS section below for some profound changes including\n\nSupport for 32-bit builds has been dropped.\nUTF-8 locales are used where available.\nThe default locations for the R installation and personal library folder have been changed.\n\nThanks to Tomas Kalibera for months of work on the Windows port for this release.\n\nNew Features: there are many, we highlight:\n\nIn a forward pipe |&gt; expression it is now possible to use a named argument with the placeholder _ in the rhs call to specify where the lhs is to be inserted.

(Reported by Alexander Fowler in PR#17964.)\n\nNew Features: there are many, we highlight:\n\nR now provides a simple native forward pipe syntax |&gt;. The simple form of the forward pipe inserts the left-hand side as the first argument in the right-hand side call.

This invalidates code incorrectly assuming that class(matrix_obj)) has length one.\nS3 methods for class “array” are now dispatched for matrix objects.\nThere is a new syntax for specifying raw character constants similar to the one used in C++: r”(…)” with … any character sequence not containing the sequence ‘⁠)“⁠’. This makes it easier to write strings that contain backslashes or both single and double quotes. For more details see ?Quotes.\nR now uses a ‘⁠stringsAsFactors = FALSE⁠’ default, and hence by default no longer converts strings to factors in calls to data.frame() and read.table().\nA large number of packages relied on the previous behaviour and so have needed/will need updating.\nThe plot() S3 generic function is now in package base rather than package graphics, as it is reasonable to have methods that do not use the graphics package. The generic is currently re-exported from the graphics namespace to allow packages importing it from there to continue working, but this may change in future.\nPackages which define S4 generics for plot() should be re-installed and package code using such generics from other packages needs to ensure that they are imported rather than rely on their being looked for on the search path (as in a namespace, the base namespace has precedence over the search path)."

Serialized data in format 3 cannot be read by versions of R prior to version 3.5.0. Serialization format version 2 is still supported and can be selected by version = 2 in the save/serialization functions. The default can be changed back for the whole R session by setting environment variables R_DEFAULT_SAVE_VERSION and R_DEFAULT_SERIALIZE_VERSION to 2. For maximal back-compatibility, files ‘vignette.rds’ and ‘partial.rdb’ generated by R CMD build are in serialization format version 2, and resave by default produces files in serialization format version 2 (unless the original is already in format version 3).\nThe default method for generating from a discrete uniform distribution (used in sample(), for instance) has been changed. This addresses the fact, pointed out by Ottoboni and Stark, that the previous method made sample() noticeably non-uniform on large populations. See PR#17494 for a discussion. The previous method can be requested using RNGkind() or RNGversion() if necessary for reproduction of old results. Thanks to Duncan Murdoch for contributing the patch and Gabe Becker for further assistance.\nThe output of RNGkind() has been changed to also return the ‘kind’ used by sample()."
